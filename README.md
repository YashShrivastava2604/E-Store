üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

Frontend
Framework: React 19 (built with Vite for blazing-fast development).
Styling: Tailwind CSS 4 for a utility-first, highly maintainable design system.
State Management: Zustand, chosen for its simplicity, minimal boilerplate, and excellent performance. It manages global state for the user, cart, and products.
Animation: Framer Motion is used extensively to create fluid, performant animations, including the "Scroll Float" effect and the "Featured Collection" carousel.
3D/Graphics: @splinetool/react-spline for integrating the interactive 3D robot directly into the React component tree.

UI Components:
Icons: Lucide React for a clean, consistent set of icons.
Analytics Charts: Recharts for rendering beautiful and interactive charts in the admin dashboard.
Notifications: React Hot Toast for providing non-intrusive user feedback.

Backend
Runtime: Node.js.
Framework: Express.js, a minimalist and flexible web application framework.
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for elegant data modeling and validation.
Authentication: A robust JWT (JSON Web Token) strategy with Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens. Tokens are stored securely in HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks. Passwords are encrypted using bcryptjs.
Caching: Redis (via Upstash) is used to cache database queries for frequently accessed data, like the list of featured products, dramatically reducing database load and speeding up response times.
Image & Asset Management: Cloudinary for powerful, cloud-based image uploading, storage, optimization, and delivery.
Payments: Stripe for handling all payment processing, including creating checkout sessions.
Email Service: Nodemailer with the Gmail SMTP server is used for sending transactional emails, such as OTP verification codes.

Deployment & Hosting
Platform: Deployed on Render.com.
Database: MongoDB Atlas.
Caching: Upstash serverless Redis.
